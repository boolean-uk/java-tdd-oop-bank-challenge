## Assumptions:
1. Bank allows customers to have one current account and one savings account
2. Customer can not withdraw more than 200 from his savings account
3. All attributes are private with getters and setters
4. Customer class accounts array contains the current account in position 0 and the savings account in 1. When customer is created the array is [null, null]
5. Overdraft requests are made for current accounts only, not savings
6. Main class created just so User Story 8 could be tested. Needs input from bank manager.
